IRC- Internet Relay chat

This simple tutorial on IRC(Internet Relay Chat).

What is irc?
it is nothing but a server client chat program, which is mainly designed for group 
chat(within the group chat private messaging is also possible).
for more deatails read:- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat

Why irc?
There are so many chat programs like facebook messenger, whatsapp,
line etc. All of them are free!!!(not actually!) and they dont sell ads. But 
actually what they are doing is selling our data. 
eg: http://www.propublica.org/article/yes-companies-are-harvesting-and-selling-your-social-media-profiles

	joining  irc is not thatmuch easy as joining in facebook or whatsapp etc.
But one thing that you can assure that nobody is going to do anything with your
data.

How to join?
step1: download Appication
	So many applications and APIs available now(just goolge 'irc clients'), 
But, for beginners, best way is to use an Application called "xchat".
you can downlad it from their official website:- http://xchat.org/
for ubuntu users: sudo apt-get install xchat

step2: registration and joining channels
then you want to put some details like
nick name	: <a name> (a name others actually see)
second choice	: <another name> (another choice, you can put anything 
		                 related to your first nick)
third choice	: <another one> 	"

from networks box i suggest you to choose Ubuntu server(freenode-server) and 
click connect.
* or you can choose any other servers(most popular servers and channels are
given at the end of this tuturial). 
After this step a window will come-up with bunch of channels, choose one and 
click join and close the window. And also you can use commands to join in a 
channel(for finding peoples that of your kind, google " <ur fav topic> irc channel") 
NB:you haven't registered your Nick(nick name) yet!.
for registration type: /msg NickServ <a password> <email address>
	-> you can put simple or complex password.
then you will receive a mail with "\msg .." command. copy this command and paste in 
your xchat application. Done!

you can use any number of channels(groups) at a time.
add them using command: /join <#channel>

How to make my own channel(group)?
	Yes, you can create your own channel.
type:
	/join ##mychannelname

-> single # referes to official channels, several communities, developers etc. have
   official channels, eventhough you can make offical channels(but, not recommended).
   eg: #ubuntu,#debian etc.
-> ## refers private channels.(recommended)



most popula networks: freenode, IRCnet, EFnet.
freenode channels: #gnu, ##C, #debian, #ubuntu, #python, #haskell, #xubuntu,
		   etc.
