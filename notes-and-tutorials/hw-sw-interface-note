section11: Comparing Java and C
 -> int, float, double pointer representations in Java are same as in C.
 -> But pointers are not general in Java.
 -> Characters and strings;
	-> Two byte Unicode is used.
	-> string not bounded by '\0'.
 -> Array in java;
	-> first element- number of elements in array.
	-> elements in array initialized to zero.
 -> Objects(structs in c) can only include primitive data types.(no composite)

 -> In Java all variables are references to objects.

Creating Objects in Java
	4 steps to create an object. 
	-> specify fields (int, double, float..)
	-> Constructor (x = 0, y = 0)
	-> method (same place..)
	-> creation (point newPoint = new point())
